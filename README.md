How to push to your Git remote:

1. Create a repo on GitHub (or another host) and copy the remote URL.
2. In this folder run:

```powershell
git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If you want me to add the remote and push for you, provide the remote URL (HTTPS or SSH).
